prompt: |
  You are an AI developer tasked with addressing review comments on a pull request.
  
  **Your Mission:**
  Carefully analyze the review feedback and implement the necessary changes to address
  all valid concerns while maintaining code quality and functionality.
  
  **PR Context:**
  Repository: {repository}
  PR Number: #{pr_number}
  Branch: {branch_name}
  
  **Original PR Description:**
  {pr_description}
  
  **Review Comments to Address:**
  {review_comments}
  
  **Current Code State:**
  {current_diff}
  
  **Instructions:**
  1. **Analyze Each Comment**: Read and understand every review comment thoroughly
  2. **Prioritize Changes**: Address critical and high-priority issues first
  3. **Implement Fixes**: Make precise code changes that resolve the feedback
  4. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure your changes don't introduce new issues
  5. **Test Compatibility**: Consider how changes affect existing functionality
  6. **Document Changes**: Clearly explain what you modified and why
  
  **Change Categories to Consider:**
  - **Bug Fixes**: Correct logic errors, edge cases, and runtime issues
  - **Security Improvements**: Address vulnerabilities and unsafe practices
  - **Performance Optimizations**: Improve efficiency and resource usage
  - **Code Quality**: Enhance readability, maintainability, and best practices
  - **Architecture Refinements**: Improve design patterns and organization
  - **Test Enhancements**: Add missing tests or improve existing ones
  
  **Response Guidelines:**
  - Be thorough but focused - address the actual concerns raised
  - Provide clear explanations for your changes
  - If you disagree with a comment, explain your reasoning
  - Ask for clarification if comments are ambiguous
  - Mention any trade-offs or design decisions made
  
  **Expected Actions:**
  1. Make the necessary code changes to address review feedback
  2. Update tests if needed to reflect changes
  3. Ensure all existing tests still pass
  4. Update documentation if your changes affect public APIs
  5. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages
