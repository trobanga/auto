# Phase 4: Review Cycle Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 4 implements sophisticated review cycle management for the auto tool, building on the established AI implementation and PR creation capabilities from Phase 3. This phase adds AI-powered PR reviews, human review coordination, iterative comment processing, and automated approval workflows while maintaining architectural consistency with existing patterns.

## Architecture Overview

### Review Cycle Flow
The review system implements a configurable iterative cycle:
1. **AI Review**: Automated PR analysis and comment posting
2. **Human Review**: Coordination with human reviewers through GitHub
3. **Comment Processing**: AI-powered responses to review feedback
4. **Update Implementation**: Code changes based on review comments
5. **Iteration Management**: Cycle until approval or max iterations reached

### State Management Integration
Review cycles leverage the existing `.auto/state/` system with enhanced tracking:
- Review iteration counters and history
- Comment aggregation and processing
- Approval status monitoring
- Review cycle metadata and error handling

### GitHub API Integration
All review operations use the established `gh` CLI pattern:
- PR review fetching and status monitoring
- Comment posting and thread management
- Approval detection and merge eligibility
- Review request management

    merge_cleanup_worktree: true  # Clean up worktree after merge
    comment_resolution_tracking: true  # Track individual comment resolution
    review_request_users: []  # Default reviewers to request
    draft_until_ai_approved: false  # Keep PR draft until AI review passes
```

### GitHub Integration Configuration
```yaml
github:
  review_integration:
    post_ai_reviews: true  # Post AI reviews as GitHub reviews
    ai_reviewer_name: "auto-ai-reviewer"  # Display name for AI reviews

## Error Handling Strategy

### Review Cycle Errors
- **AI Review Failures**: Retry with fallback prompts, degraded mode operation
- **GitHub API Rate Limits**: Exponential backoff with queue management
- **Human Review Timeouts**: Configurable escalation and notification workflows
- **Comment Processing Errors**: Individual comment failure isolation with batch processing
- **Merge Conflicts**: Automated detection with resolution guidance and AI assistance options

### State Recovery Mechanisms
- **Interrupted Review Cycles**: Resume from last successful checkpoint with full context restoration
- **Partial Comment Processing**: Individual comment retry with dependency tracking
- **Network Failures**: Robust retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns
- **Concurrent Review Updates**: Conflict detection and resolution with merge strategies

## Integration Points

### Phase 3 Integration
Review cycles integrate seamlessly with existing AI implementation and PR creation:
- **Automatic Review Initiation**: Review cycles begin immediately after PR creation
- **State Continuity**: Review state builds on existing workflow state structure
- **AI Agent Consistency**: Uses same agent framework with specialized review agents

### Command Line Interface
Review commands extend existing CLI patterns with comprehensive options:
```bash
auto review <pr-id>           # Trigger AI review cycle
auto review <pr-id> --human   # Request human review 
auto update <pr-id>           # Process review comments and update PR
auto merge <pr-id>            # Merge approved PR with cleanup
auto status --reviews         # Show review status for active PRs
```

### Configuration Integration
Review configuration extends existing hierarchical config system:
- **User-level Review Preferences**: Personal review agent and timeout settings
- **Project-level Review Policies**: Team-specific approval requirements and reviewer assignments
- **Environment Overrides**: Runtime configuration for review behavior and integration settings
