## Issue #1: Implement PR Review Validation for Merge Automation

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `priority-high`, `phase-5`, `merge-automation`  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days  
**Milestone:** Phase 5 - Week 1

### Background

The auto tool has complete review cycle management (Phase 4) and needs merge automation (Phase 5). Per CODEBASE_KNOWLEDGE.md, the merge workflow in `auto/workflows/merge.py` exists but has stubbed validation functions that need implementation.

### Description

Implement the `_validate_reviews()` function to validate that a PR has sufficient approvals and no blocking change requests before allowing merge operations.

### Implementation Requirements

**File:** `auto/workflows/merge.py`  
**Function Signature:**
```python
async def _validate_reviews(pr_number: int, repository: GitHubRepository, config: Config) -> ValidationResult
```

**Dependencies:**
- Use existing `GitHubIntegration.get_pr_reviews()` from `auto/integrations/github.py`
- Leverage `GitHubReviewIntegration` patterns from `auto/integrations/review.py`
- Integration with configuration system for approval requirements

**Implementation Details:**
1. Fetch PR reviews using existing GitHub integration patterns
2. Check for required approval count from configuration (`workflows.require_human_approval`, `github.required_approvals`)
3. Verify no outstanding change requests that would block merge
4. Validate reviewer requirements if configured
5. Handle stale reviews (approvals given before new commits)
6. Return structured `ValidationResult` with success status and detailed messages

### Technical Specifications

**Configuration Integration:**
```yaml
workflows:
  require_human_approval: true
  required_approvals: 1

github:
  required_reviewers: []  # Optional specific reviewers
```

**Return Model:**
```python
@dataclass
class ValidationResult:
    success: bool
    message: str
    details: Dict[str, Any]
    actionable_items: List[str]
```

### Acceptance Criteria

2. Integrate with existing configuration hierarchy and validation
3. Provide sensible defaults for all merge automation behaviors
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing configuration files
5. Add comprehensive documentation and help text for CLI

### Technical Specifications

**New Configuration Model:**
```python
class MergeConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for merge automation behavior."""
    auto_merge: bool = False                    # Enable automatic merge after approval
    merge_method: str = "merge"                 # merge, squash, rebase
    delete_branch_on_merge: bool = True         # Automatic branch cleanup
    required_approvals: int = 1                 # Minimum approvals needed
    wait_for_checks: bool = True                # Wait for CI/CD completion
    check_timeout: int = 600                    # Max wait time for checks (seconds)
    conflict_resolution_guidance: bool = True   # Provide AI-assisted conflict guidance
    issue_auto_close: bool = True               # Automatically close related issues
    worktree_cleanup_on_merge: bool = True      # Clean up worktree after merge
    auto_merge_delay: int = 0                   # Delay before auto-merge (seconds)
    require_manual_approval: bool = False       # Override for sensitive repos
    
    @validator('merge_method')
    def validate_merge_method(cls, v):
        allowed = ['merge', 'squash', 'rebase']
        if v not in allowed:
            raise ValueError(f'merge_method must be one of {allowed}')
        return v
    
    @validator('required_approvals')
    def validate_required_approvals(cls, v):
        if v < 0 or v > 10:
            raise ValueError('required_approvals must be between 0 and 10')
        return v
```

**Configuration Integration:**
```python
class Config(BaseModel):
    # Existing configuration fields...
